TO-DO:
- finish PositionPredictor.java
- add accelerometer readings to Sensors.java
- do auto
- USE PATHWEAVER FOR AUTO!!!
- If position predictor doesn't work properly, maybe don't strafe in auto?  Accurate odometry
seems really tough to do, and the odometry could be turned off after the auto phase, leaving the
strafing and complicated mecanum stuff for the drive team
- Trapezoidal motion profiling in DriveTrainMecanum
