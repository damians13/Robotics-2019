TO-DO:
- finish PositionPredictor.java
- add accelerometer readings to Sensors.java
- do auto
- USE PATHWEAVER FOR AUTO!!!
- If position predictor doesn't work properly, maybe don't strafe in auto?  Accurate odometry
seems really tough to do, and the odometry could be turned off after the auto phase, leaving the
strafing and complicated mecanum stuff for the drive team

- Motion profiling idea if PathWeaver doesn't work out:
  - Create class for individual wheel motors containing desired velocity
  - Create a class that holds all 4 wheels, along with methods to apply speed and rotation to the motors (very similar to mecanum algorithm)
  - These methods would add positive and negative values together, and these values could be determined based on desired trajectory, forward
  movement, desired side to side movement, and maximum operating speed
